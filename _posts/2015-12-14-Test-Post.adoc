Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.

Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. You need the dark in order to show the light. Use what you see, don't plan it. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. All kinds of happy little splashes. In life you need colors.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. And right there you got an almighty cloud.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Only eight colors that you need.

We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Be brave. Happy painting, God bless.
